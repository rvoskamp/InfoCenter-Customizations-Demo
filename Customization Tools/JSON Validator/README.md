# Using JSON files with InfoCenter

InfoCenter customizations uses JSON (*.json*) files for defining some of the components. It is strongly recommend to validate their contents to avoid them being ommitted due to a syntax error.

To assist with this validation we have included **JSON Validator.py**. Simply Drag & drop any *.json* file onto the JSON Validator.py file and a window will open displaying the results of scan.
